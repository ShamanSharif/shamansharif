# Hello World
Welcome to my first ever blog website. 
(Minus the time I created a wordpress site for no reason) 

This is for documentation purpose. This will be the journal of my development journey. And trust me, this will be a wildest one.

There is also something that I want to tick while deploying this blog site.

### Those Checkboxes Are:
- [ ] Have two branches, `dev` and `prod`.
- [ ] Have `WoodPecker-CI` to build from the dev branch and host it on my home server.
- [ ] Have `Github Actions` to build from the main branch and host it on the [Github Pages](https://shamansharif.github.io) for the world to see.


_PS. if you're a nerd like me. You can also checkout the dev branch and not wait for the merge to main._

If you are seeing this on [Github Pages](https://shamansharif.github.io) that means the checkboxes are checked. 

Time spent on this: 1 Hour
